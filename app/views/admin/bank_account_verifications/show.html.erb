    <p>Please confirm the <strong>two micro deposits</strong> (deposits made to your account that are in cents) made to the followingÂ account.</p>
    <p>By confirming these two micro deposits we are able to confirm you have ownership of the bank account you have added here before you can make purchases.</p>
    <p>Verification amounts normally show on the bank account owner's statement as &quot;Balanced verification&quot; within 2 business days (usually much faster).</p>
    <p>You have 3 tries to enter the correct values. Please be very careful that they are accurate when entering them. If you have any questions or need help please contact <a href="https://localorbit.zendesk.com/anonymous_requests/new">Local Orbit Support</a>.</p>
