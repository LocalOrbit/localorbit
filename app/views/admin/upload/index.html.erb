Here's a very not designed thing to import products. FUN FUN FUN! Only admins can see this.

<br>

<h2>Import Products</h2>
<%= form_tag({action: :upload}, multipart: true) do %>
  <%= file_field_tag 'datafile' %>
  <br></br>
  <p>Please select the market supplier for which you are uploading data.</p>
	 <%= select_tag 'profile',  options_for_select(@suppliers_available) %> <!-- not an ideal long-term solution; this looks at zynga crosslisted markets only -->
	<br>
	<br>
  <%= submit_tag "Import" %>
<% end %>
