  # save it in an instance variable in the show route so it can be rendered
  # inst variable that can be passed into that view
  # which should then be renderable in the modal

  # hitting order item controller edit method
  # in that controller, there would be a method to 

  # call the show in the orderitems controller with that id that you get via edit link
  # add show -- that does find by id
  # basically puts in @order_item that would be used in the view for rendering the modal form
  # so basically that edit link calls the route for the show in order_item
  # maybe write an edit also? can show edit them? it should go to the modal

  # define a custom order_edit route 
  # is in routes -- orders/order_items
  # should be able to validate this route with a view renderable in orders that references the order_item route when modal form is rendered
