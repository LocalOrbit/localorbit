			<h2>Re-linking the Food Chain</h2>
			People are hungry for food that's produced by farmers, ranchers and artisans they know and trust. They want to spend a larger share of their food dollars in their own communities. Local Orbit's services create stronger, more efficient food networks that can meet the demand for the food produced closer to where we live.
			<br />&nbsp;<br />
			Our flexible, localized tools are designed to support the businesses and organizations that are rebuilding local and regional supply chains.
			<br />&nbsp;<br />
			Local Orbit has evolved through two years of conversations with farmers, food producers, chefs, eaters and people working to solve food distribution challenges. We've heard countless stories about disconnected markets and inefficient communications. 
			<br />&nbsp;<br />
			We serve every link in this food chain beautifully, by providing an elegant platform for multi-channel sales, streamlined purchasing and efficient business management.

			Ragan Erickson's backyard is filled with chickens and seasonal crops, which makes her a perfect Local Orbit evangelist to the local food haven of Southern California. Prior to joining the Local Orbit, Ragan spent 10 years working for the region's only sustainable winery and restaurant. As Direct Sales and Marketing Manager, she created a wine club and launched one of the first online wine store in Southern California. She also managed customer service procedures and standards for 100 employees.

			Ragan spent much of her early career working in her family's restaurant business, and she joined Local Orbit because the company intersects her passions for slow food and new media. "Working with a company that helps people build healthier communities through local food is a dream come true," she said. <br> <br>
