			<h2>Re-linking the Food Chain</h2>
			Local Orbit is building flexible, localized tools designed to help people build healthier communities through better food.  
			<br />&nbsp;<br />
			Our web platform provides custom online marketplaces and back-office infrastructure for businesses and people working to increase local food distribution.
			<br />&nbsp;<br />
			Local Orbit has evolved through two years of conversations with farmers, food producers, chefs, eaters and people working to solve food distribution challenges. We've heard countless stories about disconnected markets and inefficient communications. 
			<br />&nbsp;<br />
			People are hungry for food that's produced by farmers, ranchers and artisans<br /> they know and trust. They want to spend a larger share of their food dollars in<br /> their own communities.
			<br />&nbsp;<br />
			Local Orbit's services create stronger, more efficient food networks that can meet the demand for food thatâ€™s produced closer to where we live.

				Local Orbit is the creation of people who are passionate about re-building local 
				food systems. We know farmers don't want to spend their days online, but we also 
				know demand for access to local food is very high, rapidly growing, and not going 
				away. It's our goal to serve every link in this food chain beautifully, by providing
				an elegant platform for multi-channel sales, streamlined purchasing and efficient 
				business management.
				<br />&nbsp;<br />
				Our team brings an energetic mix of startup savvy, technical obsession, marketing 
				prowess and food business to its work to power the New Food Economy.
