<h2>Walk away from Hub Camp with a 6-month action plan to hit the ground running!</h2>
<p>An action-oriented approach to learning, launching and adapting as you grow your local food system.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business Model Mapping.</li>
  <li>Operations &amp; Service Design.</li>
  <li>Work through your unique challenges with farmer development, buyer education, finance, food safety, logistics, operations and storytelling.</li>
  <li>Three hands-on days with experienced operators who have launched and managed supply chain businesses.</li>
  <li>To maximize impact attendance is limited to 15 participants.</li>
  <li>Note: Hub Camp is focused on operating a local food distribution business, and will not focus on technology.
