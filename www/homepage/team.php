			<h1>Management</h1>
			Local Orbit is the creation of people who are passionate about re-building local food systems. We know farmers don’t want to spend their days online, but we also know demand for access to local food is very high, rapidly growing and not going away. It’s our goal to serve every link in this food chain beautifully, by providing an elegant platform for multi-channel sales, streamlined purchasing and efficient business management. 
			<br />&nbsp;<br />
			Our team brings an energetic mix of startup savvy, technical obsession, marketing prowess and food business to its work to power the New Food Economy.
