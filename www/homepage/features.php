						<div class="home_paragraph">
							Local Orbit creates online marketplaces for farmers, producer coops, food markets, farmers markets, distributors and buying groups. <br /><br />They set standards for each marketplace and know who's producing the best food in their communities. Market managers approve each seller before they can list products.
