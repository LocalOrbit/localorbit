# 2.0 panos: Is it possible to enable smilies in recent_comments?


### Maniac: I needed comments and pings displayed in one list combined 

###produzentin: ich wollte mal vorsichtig nachfragen, ob es eine version geben
###wird, in der man trackbacks und comments zusammen abfragen und unter ein
###überschrift darstellen kann (siehe comment 213). oder geht das jetzt schon?

# 2.0 Keith: One enhancement would be to provide %comment_age as well, so that you could show a comment as “14 minutes ago” or something, but that gets complicated when handling multiple languages. Oh, wait, I just saw there’s a human_time_diff() function in WordPress that handles the language issue, so %comment_age is easy to add.

<a href="http://www.cricket.mailliw.com" rel="external nofollow">Will</a>: Is it possible to call the plugin and provide the parameters directly, over-riding the “Options” page?

###DONE Zonekiller: I’d like to insert “comment_time” after comment_author” to abtain something like this:
###Recent Comments
###zonekiller: 18:00
###samred: 17:50
###jack234: 15:50

###eyolf: Is there a way to customize the output so that all comments to the same
###post are grouped together under one heading

touchan: I’m trying to translate your recent comments plugin into Japanese, and make langauge failes (po/mo failes) for it.
And this is a tiny favor. Could you put

　load_plugin_textdomain(’get-recent-comments’)

on your next release?

Matt: Since the tagboard plugin sets up the tagboard as a static page, I was wondering whether it would be possible for your recent comments plugin to have an option exclude not only certain categories, but certain static pages.

# done in 1.5.4 
#beej: I just noticed that if the commenter does not supply a url, the link
#points to the current post the viewer is on. Is there a way for the link to
#point to the post the comment was made?
#
#carl: I have the commenters name link to their url. But if they did not supply
#a url (or i deleted it) it links to my home page. Is there a way to make no
#link appear if their isn o link?
#
#
#FilSchiesty: I think that if a comment author does not type a url in the form,
#then it should not link back to my website, it should just be author name
#without the link.

Fair Tax: This worked wonderfully. THANK YOU. Looked for a PayPal lnk to send you a tip, but couldn’t find one. Feel free to e-mail me, though.  Joshua

 Chele in [dot] LA: was wondering can a favatar be used instead of a gravatar..

# Eingbaut in 1.5.2
#Slim: Exclude author’s comments YES or NO
#Exclude these authors, to prevent certain comments to be showing on the main page
#This is Zimbabwe: we’d like to exclude links to all our comments, and prioritise those left by visitors
#

### War kein bug ### Tobi: %post_title funktioniert leider nicht. Es wird nur der Autor und der gekürzte Kommentar ausgegeben.

# herrmueller: widget

Johan: But how do I change the chop-off-dots? Typographically anal, I’d like them to be a proper ellipsis […, …] instead of three dots […].


Daniel: The plugin seems to work fine but I try to make it appear in a page instead of in the sidebar

liseur: if it can be possible to display the most recent posts in a static page, not in the sidebar.

#Excuse me for replying to myself. I believe that I found the answer at php.net. I changed trim(htmlspecialchars(stripslashes($post[’Title’]))), in get-recent-comments.php to the following:
#————————————–
#$output = str_replace(”%post_title”,
#html_entity_decode($post[’Title’]), $output);
#
#mobius: html tags in posts are not rendered as html, so you wind up getting what you see above instead of italicized type




oliver: I wonder if there is an easy way to show additional recent comment results in categories or monthly archives, filtered by that category or month. May be this could be a feature for the next plugin version?

Hi! This is a great plugin.
Just upgraded to version 1.2 and found a little bug. (Or maybe a feature?) The %comment_excerpt does not work expectedly when placed in the title-attribute of the link. The following, for example, outputs full (not shortened) comment:
%comment_author: %post_title
As a quick workaround, I found out that for some reason, this works:
%comment_author: %post_title%comment_excerpt
Dang. HTML-tags were ripped of. Maybe this will show up:
<li>%comment_author: <a href="%comment_link" title="%comment_excerpt">%post_title</a></li>
and
<li>%comment_author: <a href="%comment_link" title="%comment_excerpt">%post_title</a><span style="display: none;">%comment_excerpt</span></li>
