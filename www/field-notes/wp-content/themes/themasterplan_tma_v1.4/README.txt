/* CHANGELOG
-----------------------------------------------------*/

Version 1.4 (February 15, 2009) This is a major upgrade version for the Morning After theme. This version of the theme has a number of new features, including automatic thumbnail generation, threaded comments, Gravatar support and support for WordPress's in-built image wrapping classes and image galleries. I've also made quite a few minor design-related changes to the theme. Recommended WordPress version: WordPress 2.7+

Version 1.3.2 (June 23, 2008) This version fixes a security-related bug in search.php. The upgrade to 1.3.2 is strongly recommended. If you've tweaked parts of the theme and don't want to go through the trouble of replacing all your files, you can just replace your search.php file with the new one.

Also fixed a couple of relatively minor (non-security related) bugs in archive.php (number of posts in a category) and single.php (comment-related bug).

Version 1.3.1 (May 29, 2008) No major changes from version 1.3 in terms of code. Moved the theme over to Google Code, and adopted the MIT license for the theme. I've made the appropriate changes to the license and links in the README.txt file.

The following older versions of the theme are no longer available for download. I'm publishing the changelog here for reference purposes only.

Version 1.3 (March 27, 2008) Version 1.3 is what might be considered a ³major² upgrade of the Morning After theme. With this version, the theme is (finally) widget-ready, and works only with versions of WordPress upwards of 2.3. This version also features support for WordPress¹s in-built tagging functionality.

The theme download includes updated versions of the WP-Print and WP-Email plugins. If you are still using older versions of WordPress to power your Web site(s), then I¹d recommend upgrading your WordPress? installation or using the previous version of the theme. (Keep in mind version 1.2 of the theme is not widget-compatible.) The documentation provided below for customising various aspects of the theme applies to this version as well, no changes there (unless specifically indicated).

Version 1.2 (September 22, 2007) Implemented an easier method to assign posts as ³Featured². Also in the earlier version, the single post layout was skewed if users were required to register/log in to post comments. Now fixed (comments.php). Fine-tuned style.css as well.

Version 1.1 (September 17, 2007) Fixed a bug in archive.php pertaining to the number of posts displayed in the left sidebar (²This category contains Œx¹ posts²). If a post belonged to multiple categories, then the number of posts in the category wasn¹t displayed accurately. It should work fine now. Also includes a couple minor changes to header.php.

Version 1.0 (September 15, 2007) The first version of The Morning After theme released.
