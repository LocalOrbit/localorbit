/*
	Styles to make ordinary <INPUT type="text"/> look like a slider control.
	Use with JQuerySlider.js to provide the slide functionality by reacting to mouse etc.
	(Requires a reference to the JQuery library found at http://jquery.com/src/latest/)
	(Hats-off to John Resig for creating the excellent JQuery library. It is fab.)

	This control is achieved with no extra html markup whatsoever and uses unobtrusive javascript.

	Do contact me with comments and suggestions but please don't ask for support.
	As much as I'd love to help with specific problems I have plenty to get on with already!

	Go ahead and use it in your own projects. This code is provided 'as is'.
	Sure I've tested in heaps of ways. Its good for me, but you use it at your own risk.
	SoftwareUnity and I are certainly not responsible if your computer sets fire to the sofa,
	hacks into the pentagon, hijacks a plane or gives you any kind of hassle whatsoever.

	Apologies for the blatent use of company initials on class names etc, but I find them
	very helpful in preventing conflicts with other class names in other stylesheets.
