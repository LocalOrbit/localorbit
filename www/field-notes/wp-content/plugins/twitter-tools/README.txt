Twitter Tools is a plugin that creates a complete integration between your WordPress blog and your Twitter account.

== Description ==

Twitter Tools integrates with Twitter by giving you the following functionality:

* Connect multiple Twitter accounts (via Social)
* Archive the tweets from your Twitter accounts (downloaded every 10 minutes)
* Create a blog post from each of your tweets
* Create a tweet on Twitter whenever you post in your blog, with a link to the blog post (via Social)
* Browse your tweets locally by @mention, #hashtag or user account (optionally display these publicly)

Twitter Tools leverages Social's connection to Twitter so that you don't have to create an app and copy keys around. It supports multiple accounts (must be authorized as "global" accounts in Social) with settings on a per-account basis.


== Installation ==

_Twitter Tools relies on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/social/">Social</a> plugin to connect to Twitter. If you aren't already using this plugin please install it before installing Twitter Tools._

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'twitter-tools' directory into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Twitter Tools.
4. Go to the Twitter Tools Options page (Settings > Twitter Tools) to set up your Twitter information and preferences.


== Upgrading ==

If you have upgraded from an older version of Twitter Tools, your data will need to be converted to the new Twitter Tools format. On the Twitter Tools Options page you will see a prompt to upgrade if appropriate. Follow the steps to convert your data.

Twitter Tools now stores complete Twitter data along with your basic tweet content. Over time, Twitter Tools will request this data for upgraded tweets. This process make take a few days, as only 10 tweets are requested per hour (to avoid egatively impacting your rate limit).


== Connecting Accounts ==

Any Twitter accounts connected on the Social settings page are available for Twitter Tools. You can enable them on a per-account account basis, as well as specifying per-account preferences for creating blog posts, etc. (on the Twitter Tools options screen).


== Managing your Tweets ==

You can view, edit and delete (or unpublish) the local copy of your Tweets right in your WordPress admin. Navigate the tweets from the "Tweets" menu item and manage them just as you would any other post type. Twitter Tools does not know if you've deleted a tweet on Twitter, so you'll need to also delete the copy of the tweet from the admin to remove it from your WordPress site.


== Displaying your Tweets ==

Twitter Tools include options to create URLs for your local tweets using the following scheme:

- single tweet: http://alexking.org/tweets/253580615113400321
- account archive: http://alexking.org/tweet-accounts/alexkingorg
- @mention archive: http://alexking.org/tweet-mentions/sogrady
- #hashtag archive: http://alexking.org/tweet-hashtags/monktoberfest

You can enable public URLs for your tweets in your Twitter Tools settings. If you choose not to enable public URLs for your tweets, you can still vuew and manage them from within the admin screens.

= Shortcode =

You can use a shortcode to display a list of tweets.

	[aktt_tweets account="alexkingorg"] 

If you want, you can specify some additional parameters to control how many tweets are displayed:

	[aktt_tweets account="alexkingorg" count="5" offset="0"]

You can also choose to explicitly include or exclude replies and retweets:

	[aktt_tweets account="alexkingorg" include_rts="0" include_replies="1"]

If you want to limit the tweets to specific @mentions or #hashtags, you can to that as well:

	[aktt_tweets account="alexkingorg" mentions="crowdfavorite,twittertools" hashtags="wordpress,plugin,twittertools"]

= Widget =

The options for the shortcode are also available for the Twitter Tools widget via a few settings.

= Create Blog Posts =

Twitter Tools can create a blog post from each of your Tweets. This feature can be enabled on a per-account basis. If there is an image included in the media data of the tweet Twitter Tools will try to save that image as the featured image for the post and append it to the blog post content.

Please note that this will take effect for all future tweets, it does not retroactively create posts for older tweets (though you could pretty easily script it to do so if you desired).


== Customization ==

Twitter Tools is designed to be customizable via the standard hook/filter API. If you find you need additional hooks (or to suggest other bug fixes and enhancements) please create a pull request on GitHub.

https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-twitter-tools

Get creative! Here are some examples of ways to use more of the full Twitter data to create links back into Twitter where appropriate:

- linking to the original tweet on Twitter
- linking to "in reply to" tweets


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I don't want to use Social's comment display? =

All of Social's features (broadcasting, comment display, looking for responses on Twitter and Facebook and the ability to log in with Twitter or Facebook) can be disabled on Social's settings screen.

= Will Twitter Tools pull in my entire tweet archive from Twitter? =

Twitter Tools starts archiving from the time you enable it. It does not try to download your entire tweet history. However, there is code in Twitter Tools that can be scripted to download and import tweets. You can put together the pieces with your own code to create the combination of features you desire. Here's an Gist to get you started:

3. Manage your tweets in the standard WordPress admin interface.
