The Custom Admin Branding Plugin allows you to re-brand the Wordpress login screen, the admin header and footer with your own custom images.

== Description ==

The Custom Admin Branding Plugin allows you to re-brand the Wordpress login screen, the admin header and footer with your own custom images. 

It should be fairly easy to use for anyone familiar with Wordpress and has basic css and html skills. At its simplest it only requires you to activate and then replace three images with your own. Photoshop templates are included to help you with that.

== Installation ==

1. Download the Custom Branding Plugin
1. Upload the ‘custom_branding’ folder to your plugins folder
1. Go to the plugin section in your admin and activate

Customization

Using the Photoshop templates, replace the custom images in the images folder with your own.
If you are familiar and competent (or just adventurous) with css you can customize the values in the included css files. Some of things you may wish to change are:

* The bg color, border, and text color of the alert box in the login screen
* The bg color and text color of the admin header (note that there are different values for regular text and links)

The image in the footer can be linked as well. I use that area to put my logo for sites I’ve created for clients. To change this go to the settings section in the WP admin and choose the "Custom Admin Branding" setting.  Enter your link in the text box and click update.
