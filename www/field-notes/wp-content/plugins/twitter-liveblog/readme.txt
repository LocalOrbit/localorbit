== Description ==

Twitter LiveBlog integrates with Twitter and lets you liveblog on your Wordpress blog. It gives you the following functionality:

* Add to the liveblogging post using Twitter updates. Each Twitter update will appear as a separate line in the post with a timestamp.
* End a liveblogging post using a Twitter update.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it.
2. Put the twitter-liveblog folder into /wp-content/plugins/
3. Go to the Plugins page in your Wordpress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Twitter LiveBlog.
4. IMPORTANT: Go to the Twitter LiveBlog Options page (Options > Twitter LiveBlog) to set your Twitter account information, liveblogging preferences and to set up Twitter update checking. You must save the Twitter LiveBlog options to enable liveblogging.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I start a new liveblog post? =

Send a Twitter update that begins with "//NLB//" (this is case sensitive). This will create a new Wordpress post. Any text following the "//NLB//" will be used as the title of the post. For example, the Twitter update "//NLB// Sample Post" will create a new Wordpress post with the title "Sample Post". If no text follows "//NLB//", the Wordpress post will have the default title "Live Blogging".

= How do I end a liveblog post? =

Send a Twitter update that begins with "//ELB//" (this is case sensitive). This will end the liveblog post. Any subsequent Twitter updates will be ignored and will not be added to this liveblog post.

= How do I send updates to an open liveblog post? =

All Twitter updates sent after sending a "//NLB//" update will be added to the liveblog post. Each Twitter update will appear on its own line preceded by a timestamp.

= Can I use this plugin with the Twitter Tools plugin? =

Yes. The liveblog post created by Twitter LiveBlog will not cause Twitter Tools to send a "New blog post" notification to Twitter.

= Why are my Twitter updates not showing up in a liveblog post? =

Make sure that you are using the correct username/password for the Twitter account. Go to the Twitter LiveBlog Options page (Options > Twitter LiveBlog) to set your Twitter account information and save your settings. Make sure you are using "//NLB//" in your Twitter update to begin a new post.
