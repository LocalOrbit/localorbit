Adds subscription option icons for your RSS Feed URL; your FeedBurner Email Service URL and your Twitter Stream URL. Totally user-defined.

== Description ==
The most common ways for people to subscribe to a blog and its content are through RSS, Email and Twitter. This plugin places three matching icons in a widget area and lets users enter their own feed URLs. It's really simple but there's lots of power under the hood.

= Features: =
* Offers an attractive range of subscription options for your readers using familiar-looking icons.
* Intuitive interface for editing options, including your feed URLs, widget title and icon sizes.
* Independent handling across multiple widget instances, using WordPress 2.8's new widget_class coolness.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin by hitting that big red button to the right.
2. Extract the files and place the entire 'subscription-options' folder into your wp_content/plugins directory.
3. Go to your 'Installed Plugins' panel and activate 'Subscription Options'.
4. You are now ready to use the widget.

= Setup: =
1.  Go to your 'Appearance > Widgets' panel and select the widget area you wish for the plugin to appear in.
2.  Enter the following **totally optional** details:
* Widget Title
* RSS Feed URL
* Email Service URL
* Twitter Stream URL
* Size of Feed Icons
3.  Hit 'Save' then test the result. Change the size of the icons if  necessary.

== Screenshots ==
1.  This is how the plugin could look on your blog.
2.  This is the widget options panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where do I put the widget? =
You can place the widget wherever you like as long as it is within a pre-defined widget area. I haven't worked out how to let people place the widget wherever they like. Let me know if you can help on my [contact page](http://digitalcortex.net/contact) though.

= Can I style the widget in my own way? =
Yes of course, it's WordPress! You can use your stylesheet.css to override your theme's default widget settings by using the following CSS classes:

* the widget container > div.suboptions_widget
* the RSS feed icon > img.rss_icon
* the email service icon > img.mail_icon
* the twitter icon > img.twitter_icon

Please note that the icons' sizes will still need to be set from within the widget admin panel. CSS doesn't let you override that.
