Keep your valuable WordPress website, its media and database backed up to Dropbox in minutes with this sleek, easy to use plugin.

== Description ==

[WordPress Backup to Dropbox](http://wpb2d.com) has been created to give you peace of mind that your blog is backed up on a regular basis.

Just choose a day, time and how often you wish yor backup to be performed and kick back and wait for your websites files
and a SQL dump of its database to be dropped in your Dropbox!

You can set where you want your backup stored within Dropbox and on your server as well as choose what files or directories,
if any, you wish to exclude from the backup.

The plugin uses [OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) so your Dropbox account details are not stored for the
plugin to gain access.

Checkout the website - http://wpb2d.com

= Setup =

Once installed, the authorization process is easy -

1. When you first access the plugin’s options page, it will ask you to authorize the plugin with Dropbox.

2. A new window will open and Dropbox will ask you to authenticate and grant the plugin access.

3. Finally, click continue to setup your backup.

= Minimum Requirements =

1. PHP 5.2.16 or higher with [cURL support](http://www.php.net/manual/en/curl.installation.php)

2. [A Dropbox account](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTM1NTcwNjc5)

Note: Version 1.3 of the plugin supports PHP < 5.2.16 and can be [downloaded here.](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wordpress-backup-to-dropbox.1.3.zip)

= Errors and Warnings =

During the backup process the plugin may experience problems that will be raised as an error or a warning depending on
its severity.

A warning will be raised if your PHP installation is running in safe mode, if you get this warning please read my blog
post on dealing with this.

If the backup encounters a file that is larger then what can be safely handheld within the memory limit of your PHP
installation, or the file fails to upload to Dropbox it will be skipped and a warning will be raised.

The plugin attempts to recover from an error that may occur during a backup where backup process goes away for an unknown
reason. In this case the backup will be restarted from where it left off. Unfortunately, at this time, it cannot recover
from other errors, however a message should be displayed informing you of the reason for failure.

= Premium Extensions =

Premium extensions are downloadable snippets of code that add extra functionality to WordPress Backup to Dropbox. The extensions are features have been requested but may not appeal to all users. Instead of complicating the plugin by adding them to the core, premium extensions allows you to choose what extra functionality you want.

Premium extensions can be purchased securely using [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com) and installed with the click of a button. For more information pelase visit http://wpb2d.com/premium.

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a free Dropbox account? =

Browse to http://db.tt/szCyl7o and create a free account.

= Where is my backup located? Can I move it? =
By default your backup is located in 'Applications/wpb2d'. You can move the 'wpb2d' folder anywhere your want in your Dropbox. You can even rename it to 'my super awesome backup' or anything else if you want!

= Nothing seems to happen when backing up, whats up? =

Your server settings (.htaccess file) might be blocking wp-cron which is required to start the backup process. You will need to add the following to a .htaccess file in your WordPress root directory:

<Files "wp-cron.php">
Allow from All
Satisfy Any
</Files>

For information please refer to this thread - http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wordpress-backup-to-dropbox-nothing-seems-to-happen-when-backing-up

= Why doesn't my backup execute at the exact time I set? =

This could be because your blog's timezone is not set. By defauly it is set to UTC+0, so if you set your backup to start at midnight it will
be kicked off at 4pm (PST) in LA. You can change your blogs timezone in WordPress' General Settings.

If your timezone is correct then WordPress' scheduling system could be the problem. Unlike a cron job, kicks of tasks the next time your
blog is accessed after the scheduled time. If you are using a caching solution then the plugin may be blocking calls to wp-cron.php, if so
you will need to whitelist this file in the plugin settings.

= Where is my database SQL dump located? =
The database is backed up into two files named '[database name]-backup-core.sql' that contains all the core WordPress tables and data,
and '[database name]-backup-plugins.sql' that cotains tables and data related to your plugins.
These files will be will be found at the path 'wp-content/backups' within the App folder of your Dropbox.

= Wow! My second backup was heaps faster. Why is that? =
In order to save time and bandwidth the plugin only uploads files that have changed since the last backup. The only exception
is your SQL dump file that will be uploaded every time.

= Can I perform a backup if my PHP installation has safe mode enabled? =
Yes you can, however you need to modify the max execution time in your php.ini manually.
[Please read this blog post for more information.](http://www.mikeyd.com.au/2011/05/24/setting-the-maximum-execution-time-when-php-is-running-in-safe-mode/)

= How can I revert to a previous version of a backed up file? =
Dropbox has this functionality built in and it is extremely easy to do.
[Please read this blog post for more information.](http://www.mikeyd.com.au/2011/06/05/restoring-previous-versions-of-files-in-dropbox/)

= Why does my backup keep stalling and restarting? =
Sometimes hosts implement measures to prevent long running tasks like a backup. To circumvent this I have implemented a backup monitor that restarts the backup if it is terminated before it is fully completed. So it is quite normal to see up to ten or more backup restarts.

= Why cant I see the exclude files and directories widget in Internet Explorer 7? =
That is because it only supports IE8 or higher or any of the awesome modern better alternatives like Google Chrome, Firefox,
Opera, etc. In order to use the widget you have no choice but to update to IE8 or any of the aforementioned browsers.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Settings: Choose the date, time, frequency and what files or directories you wan't to exclude.
2. The Log: Know what you backup is doing.
3. Premium Extensions: Add extra functionality with ease and a 60 day money back guarantee.
