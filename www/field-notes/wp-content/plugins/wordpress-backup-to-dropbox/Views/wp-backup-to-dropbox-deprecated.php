			<p>Gday,</p>
			<p>WordPress Backup to Dropbox is striving to be the #1 backup solution for WordPress and, in order to do so, it needs to use the latest technologies available.</p>
			<p>So, unfortunately your version of PHP (%s) is below version 5.2.16 that is the minimum required version to perform a reliable and successful backup.
			It is <em>STRONGLY</em> recommended that you upgrade to PHP 5.3 or higher because, <a href="%s">as of December 2010</a>, version 5.2 is no longer supported by the PHP community.
			Or, alternatively PHP >= 5.2.16.
			<p>If this is not possible, WPB2D 1.3 supports PHP < 5.2.16 and can be <a href="%s">downloaded here</a> and installed using the WordPress plugin uploader.
			Although this version works 100%%, and has the same premium extensions, it will only be supported with bug fix releases.</p>
			<p>Cheers,<br />Mikey</p>
