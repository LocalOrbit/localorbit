<p>If you see anything but CSS code below, your problem is that your server disables PHP files execution when found in <code>wp-content</code> directory. It's either done by a .htaccess rule you made, a plugin you uploaded, or sever configuration. In case 1 or 2, you're on your own. In case 3, contact your server admin. In any case: this server limitation is totally useless regarding hacks and stuff. Just thought I'd let you know.</p>
