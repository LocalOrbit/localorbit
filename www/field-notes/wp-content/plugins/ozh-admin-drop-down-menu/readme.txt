All admin links available in a neat horizontal drop down menu. Saves lots of screen real estate!

== Description ==

The lazy and the productive will love it : all admin links available in a neat horizontal CSS driven drop down menu. No need to click on "Manage" then "Pages" to edit pages, go to *any admin page* from *any admin page*.

For documentation, examples, screenshot and a live demo, please refer to the official plugin page for [Admin Drop Down Menu](http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-admin-menu-drop-down-css/ "Admin Drop Down Menu"). There is also an API for plugin coders (give your plugin its own special icon!).

Current version is for WordPress 2.7+ only. For WordPress 2.6.5 and older, see the plugin's page.
