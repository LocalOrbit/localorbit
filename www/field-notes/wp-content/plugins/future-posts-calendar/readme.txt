This plugin adds a monthly calendar that shows all the dates you have future posts.

== Description ==
It adds a simple month-by-month calendar that shows all the months you have future posts for (and the current month no matter what), it highlights the days you have posts for, and as an added bonus if you click a day, the Post Timestamp boxes change to that day, month and year (although it doesnâ€™t check the edit timestamp box to avoid accidental changes).

== Installation ==
1. Download the zip file
1. Unzip and upload future_posts.php to your *wp-content/plugins/* folder.
1. The new box will automatically appear on edit/write post pages.
1. Optionally you can add it as a sidebar widget or uncomment the line "//add_action('activity_box_end', 'get_future_calendar_html');" to have it appear on your dashboard, or use the Dashboard Editor plugin to add it as a widget.
