This plugin adds a monthly calendar that shows all the dates you have future posts.

== Description ==
It adds a simple month-by-month calendar that shows all the months you have future posts for (and the current month no matter what), it highlights the days you have posts for, and as an added bonus if you click a day, the Post Timestamp boxes change to that day, month and year.

Also includes a widget so you can show users what upcoming posts you have on your website.


If you want to ad a widget to your dashboard, uncomment the line `add_action('wp_dashboard_setup', 'fpc_setup_dashboard_widget');` in the future_calendar.php file.

== Installation ==
1. Download the zip file
1. Unzip and upload future_posts.php to your *wp-content/plugins/* folder.
1. The new box will automatically appear on edit/write post pages.
