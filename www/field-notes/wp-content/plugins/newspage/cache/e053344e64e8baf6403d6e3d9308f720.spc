And for good reason, as improperly managed animals  — including dogs and cats —  can be the source of all sorts of public health problems. When it comes to asthma, however, recent science is hinting that early childhood exposure to domestic animals can actually protect against the chronic condition, so well-cared-for backyard animals like chickens or miniature goats could actually have an additional, unexpected benefit.</p>
<p>I learned about this intriguing idea on <a href="http://www.kqed.org/quest/">Quest</a>, a science program produced by KQED in San Francisco (with all programs available for on-line viewing). <a href="http://www.kqed.org/quest/television/asthma">One of the segments</a> is all about asthma: what it does, how to prevent it, and why the incidence has been rising rapidly in recent years (they state that rates more than doubled in small children in the U.S. between 1980 and 1994). Asthma's underlying cause and triggers are still a mystery — as yet, no one has found the "magic allergen" or markers of genetic predisposition — and so researchers are looking at diet, stress, air pollution, early exposure to allergens and more. (For more information, consult a series of papers in <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2006/114-4/toc.html">Environmental Health Perspectives</a> examined how the environmental influences asthma, and a recent study from the <a href="&#60;br &#62;&#60;/a&#62; http://pubs.healtheffects.org/view.php?id=334">Health Effects Insitute</a> found a causal relationship between traffic-related air pollution and exacerbation of asthma in children.)</p>
<p>One thing that stands out is that asthma rates have been rising in industrialized societies like the U.S., Western Europe, Australia and Japan. And one thing that these places have in common is more time spent inside, more concrete, more cars, fewer farms, and less exposure to the natural world.</p>
<p>This leads us to one of the intriguing ideas about asthma and other allergies (and even diseases related to chronic inflammation, as <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427384.400-dirty-babies-get-healthier-hearts.html">New Scientist</a> reports): the "hygiene hypothesis." This hypothesis, first proposed a few decades ago, suggests that as our environments become cleaner and we spend less time around "dirty" things like animals and the natural world, our bodies aren't being exposed to enough microorganisms and therefore don't develop the proper defenses (or, in the case of asthma, don't overreact to external allergens).</p>
<p>The program mentions a study of children in Germany, Switzerland and Austria that supports the hypothesis. In rural communities, researchers found lower asthma rates in children whose sleeping quarters were close to the livestock stables than those who lived in town, away from the animals. One possible explanation for the difference is that exposure to the microbes found in manure and stables protects a child from developing asthma by causing favorable changes to their immune system. (Although the exact study is not mentioned in the Quest piece, I suspect it is one in the <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/347/12/869">New England Journal of Medicine</a> that concludes "Endotoxin levels in samples of dust from the child's mattress were inversely related to the occurrence of hay fever, atopic asthma, and atopic sensitization.")</p>
<p>The hygiene hypothesis and its connection to livestock are still only hypothetical at this time — there are a number of confounding results, like higher asthma rates among low-income children in allergen-laden urban areas and the link between asthma and exposure to tobacco smoke at a very early age. If it turns out that early exposure to livestock reduces the chance of developing asthma, it could be a benefit above and beyond the urban farming's main benefits of good, clean and local food.</p>
<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>Robyn O'Brien's fantastic 2009 book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767930711?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=theethi-20&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0767930711">The Unhealthy Truth: How Our Food Is Making Us Sick - And What We Can Do About It</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theethi-20&#38;l=as2&#38;o=1&#38;a=0767930711" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />,"  offers an alternative to the hygiene hypothesis when it comes to asthma. (Alas, "The Unhealthy Truth" is one of many sitting in a teetering pile Ethicurean headquarters that got read and should have been reviewed by now … and that we continue to hope will someday still be.) O'Brien talks to Harvard Medical School pediatrician David Ludwig, author of  "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SB8MVI?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=theethi-20&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B002SB8MVI">Ending the Food Fight: Guide Your Child to a Healthy Weight in a Fast Food/ Fake Food World</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theethi-20&#38;l=as2&#38;o=1&#38;a=B002SB8MVI" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />," who believes that it is the U.S. dietary shift toward fake food that has sabotaged our immune systems, both by subjecting us to an onslaught of evolutionarily-novel compounds in the form of artificial and/or genetically modified ingredients, and by depriving us of the essential nutrients to mount a defense. In this fake-food hypothesis, farm kids and those whose parents keep urban livestock would have lower asthma and food-allergy rates because they grow up in a family food culture less dependent on processed food. </em></p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/worlds-best-sommelier-vs-worlds-worst-customer">January 2010 issue of Food &#38; Wine magazine</a>, former New York Times restaurant critic Frank Bruni visits top-rated Le Bernardin (3 stars from Michelin, 4 stars from the New York Times) and acts like an ass to the sommelier as he eats his multicourse meal*. If you're into restaurant drama, or food and drink pairings, you'll probably find the article delightful. For me, it elicited only ho-hum emotions. That was, until I got to the recipe collection that chef Eric Ripert and pastry chef Michael Laiskonis** contributed to the story.</p>
<p>One of the recipes features monkfish, also known as angler fish, which has an "avoid" rating from the <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=13">Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch</a> and the Shedd Aquarium (<a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/3163.html">PDF</a>). The reason for this rating is not so much the monkfish itself, but how it is caught. The Seafood Watch page says that "monkfish are usually caught using bottom trawls, a method that can damage seafloor habitat and often results in high <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/issues/wildseafood_bycatch.aspx">bycatch.</a> ("Bycatch" is the non-target species that are caught along with the target species.) Monkfish are also caught using gillnets, and this can result in the accidental catch and death of sea turtles and marine mammals." (<a href="http://www.seafoodchoices.com/whatwedo/goodcatch.php">The Good Catch Manual</a> from the Seafood Choices Alliance has a superb primer on fishing methods.)</p>
<p>In the New York City chapter of Taras Grescoe's "<a href="http://www.bloomsburyusa.com/books/catalog/bottomfeeder_hc_250">Bottomfeeder</a>," a must-read book that I <a href="http://www.ethicurean.com/2008/04/22/bottomfeeder-review/">reviewed for Ethicurean</a> in 2008, Grescoe talks with Eric Ripert about his seafood sourcing, and notes that Ripert was one of the first chefs to take swordfish and Chilean sea bass off of his menu. In the interview, Ripert says, "We still serve some fish that are on the list, but these ones we get from dayboats. It is difficult to know where your fish is coming from, of course, if you are not catching it yourself. But I have confidence in my purveyors. Rod Mitchell buys line-caught fish, fish from dayboats. I think there's a big difference between a cod, for example, that is caught in one of those giant boats in the middle of the ocean, and one that has been caught by a local fisherman in a little boat."</p>
<p>So it's possible that the fish served to Bruni was caught in an acceptable fashion, with limited bycatch. But when a monkfish recipe appears in a mass-market magazine, all bets are off for sustainable sourcing. And it makes me wonder what Food &#38; Wine was thinking when they approved Ripert's monkfish recipe. Do they not consider the status of fish and seafood that appear in their magazine? Or was this a case of being dazzled by Le Bernardin's galaxy of stars? Food &#38; Wine is no stranger to the issue of sustainable seafood — their website features a <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/sustainable-seafood">slideshow</a> on the topic — but their attention appears to have strayed, much to the detriment of the creatures that live in the monkfish's habitat on the Atlantic sea floor.</p>
<p>Food &#38; Wine could learn from another ostensibly enlightened publication that temporarily fell off the sustainable-fish wagon. A few months ago, the New York Times' Mark Bittman published a recipe for red snapper with fruit salsa in his weekly column. <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2009-04-07-bittman-bite-ocean">Grist's Tom Philpott</a> called out Bittman for his use of the fish, which is highly endangered, rating an "avoid" from <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=41">Seafood Watch</a> unless they come from the NW Hawaiian islands. Philpott reminded Bittman and other food writers that they have higher calling than simply creating delicious recipes. To his credit, <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2009-food-writers-and-the-state-of-the-ocean">Bittman responded</a> with a <em>mea culpa</em> and a thoughtful explanation of his recognition that the seafood situation can be agonizingly complex at times for food writers, as much of the "best choices" list includes farm-raised fish, fish that are difficult to obtain, or fish that are not well liked these days. In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/weekinreview/16bittman.html">later issue of the Times</a>, Bittman took a step back to consider the big picture: fish farming,  endangered oceans, fishmeal, and the prospect of recovery for seafood stocks.</p>
<p>Magazines and newspapers have a lot of influence on what we cook and eat: they create trends, or help bring them to a halt; they act as cooking teachers, introduce us to new ingredients, and give us inspiration in the kitchen. When it comes to seafood, they can stick with the old ways, indiscriminately publishing recipes for fish without considering their populations or how they are caught or raised, or they can be part of the solution by writing about the best ways to use the seafood on the "best choices" list. At the very least, Food &#38; Wine could start by amending the Web version of the recipe and printing a correction that acknowledges the monkfish's Seafood Watch rating.</p>

<p><em>* The final savory course in the meal was an "upscale surf and turf of grilled escolar and Kobe beef with pungent anchovy-butter sauce."  Escolar, you might remember, is a fish that can be challenging for some people's digestive system and is sometimes mislabeled as "white tuna" at sushi restaurants, as <a href="http://www.ethicurean.com/2009/12/18/tuna-dna/">one of my recent posts</a> discussed.</em></p>

Happily, I can point to a handful of our producer members who are likely to have greens and other vegetables coming from their high tunnels or hoop houses, taking a page from <a href="http://www.fourseasonfarm.com/">Eliot Coleman</a>, the all-season farmer from Maine and author of the new book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603580816?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=theethi-20&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1603580816">The Winter Harvest Handbook: Year Round Vegetable Production Using Deep Organic Techniques and Unheated Greenhouses</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theethi-20&#38;l=as2&#38;o=1&#38;a=1603580816" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />."</p>
<p>Coleman has established himself in recent years as an innovative organic farmer working in challenging conditions and finding ingenious solutions. His key suggestion for growing fresh crops throughout even the harsh Maine winters involves the use of unheated greenhouses paired with floating row covers to increase the temperature around tender crops. This system has evolved to include movable cold houses that can be shifted from summer hot house crops such as tomatoes over to summer-started winter crops of greens and roots. By getting a jump start while the days are long enough to promote growth, the plants reach near-maturity before the days shorten significantly, and they can then be picked in succession throughout the winter months.</p>
<p>"In other words," Coleman explains, "we were not extending the <em>growing </em>season as one hopes to do in a heated greenhouse but, rather, we were extending the <em>harvest </em>season."</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, he has tried other solutions, such as brief minimal heating in the greenhouses and a wider variety of crops, and "The Winter Harvest Handbook" brings his previous books (especially "Four-Season Harvest") up to date. Through all the testing and use of different methods, he has kept the goals of simplicity, low cost, and energy efficiency in mind. The farm's processes have also been organized carefully: "We aim for a goal of never leaving a greenhouse bed unplanted, and we come pretty close."</p>
<p>Coleman makes a solid case that all of this experimentation has proven worthwhile, and "The Winter Harvest Handbook" offers extensive details for everything from preparing the beds to maintaining and harvesting the crops. The methods outlined can be translated elsewhere to continue to provide healthful fresh food throughout the year as well as to increase the profits of "dedicated local grower[s]... selling a premium product."</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6312" title="breezy-hill-produce" src="http://www.ethicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/breezy-hill-produce-300x208.jpg" alt="breezy-hill-produce" width="300" height="208" />Given that the winters in northeastern Ohio can be equally daunting — while we may not have as much snow or as frigid temperatures as Maine, we get a lot less sunshine — it's no wonder that local farmers have picked up on Coleman's techniques and begun to implement them in their own production methods. And with a growing demand for local foods all year round (such as we're finding now at <a href="http://www.localrootswooster.com">Local Roots Market</a>), farmers who have begun to plan their own winter harvests can easily expect to gain a faithful following.</p>
<p>Phil and Mindy Bartholomae of <a href="http://breezyhillfarmohio.com/">Breezy Hill Farm</a> and Kevin and Amy Leamer at <a href="http://www.localharvest.org/farms/M33325">Por-Bar Farm</a> have dazzled Local Roots shoppers each week with their selection of winter greens, root vegetables, and lingering summer crops such as tomatoes and hot peppers. (Personally, I love the Bartholomaes' Hakurei turnips, seen here at right, and was delighted to find that the Leamers had rutabagas available for the holiday season!) Since we're heading into the slow harvest months, I asked both couples about their winter crops and Coleman's influence.</p>
<p><strong>What crops have you planted for this winter?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>The Bartholomaes:</strong> We have leaf lettuce, spinach, bunching onions, radishes, Hakurei turnips, beets, carrots, tatsoi, mizuna, parsley, cilantro, rosemary, and mint in the tunnels.</p>
<p><strong>The Leamers:</strong> Asian greens, European greens, lettuces, cabbages, root crops, peas, fava beans -- and constantly acquiring other varieties for winter starting in our greenhouse and transplanting into our high tunnel beds.</p>
<p><strong>How and when did you first encounter Eliot Coleman's work?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_6311" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6311  " title="breezy-high-tunnel" src="http://www.ethicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/breezy-high-tunnel-300x214.jpg" alt="breezy-high-tunnel" width="300" height="214" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mindy and Phil Bartholomae</p></div>
<p><strong>Phil and Mindy Bartholomae: </strong>We had always dreamed of getting into farming big time; we always hung out at our favorite farmers' stands at our Saturday market when we lived in Cleveland. We then were transferred to Chicago in 2006, and though we knew the farm dream would have to be put on hold, we vowed to get every book available on the subject and study, study, study! I then enrolled in the University of Illinois Extension Master Gardener program and lapped up the sections on organic farming. I attended organic farm tours and then a weekend conference with Coleman as the keynote speaker. He was so understated, but so resourceful and full of knowledge about these very old methods of intensive gardening/farming with no outside input and season extension.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin and Amy Leamer:</strong> We discovered him approximately 9-10 years ago via the Internet (especially the <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com/">Johnny's Selected Seed site</a>) when we started researching organic farming. We found his books and eventually purchased "Four Season Harvest."</p>
<p><strong>What parts of what you read carried the most weight?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>The Bartholomaes:</strong> The biggest revelation for us was how critical soil health is. We take it for granted as simply a medium for roots to form in and be supported. And then we add fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides, etc., when the plants don't look healthy! Our produce is nothing without balanced, complete soil, achieved only by mimicking nature as best as possible, i.e., adding humus through animal or green manures and rotating crops so as not to deplete soil nutrition by one crop's demands.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6314" title="porbar_herbs-growing_2009" src="http://www.ethicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/porbar_herbs-growing_2009-300x225.jpg" alt="porbar_herbs-growing_2009" width="300" height="225" /><strong>The Leamers:</strong> Eliot's examples gave us the courage to act on our "instinct" that a viable small farm operation could succeed with polyculture methods, contrary to the naysayers suggesting that large monocultures were the only profitable agriculture model for the modern economic climate. Trading expensive chemical inputs for good ol' labor and working with nature just made sense to us. When we started outlining our farm plan, we referred to Eliot's variety recommendations and season extension methods. We were inspired and encouraged by information he gathered from trips to the south of France where he encountered much fresh produce available in the middle of winter.</p>
<p><strong>What methods/tools/crops of his do you use on your farm?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bartholomaes: </strong>We have 2 high tunnels, one a "cold" tunnel with 2 layers of plastic and no added heat, and the other with some added heat to keep above 26. We also have used row covers of spun polyester out in the field to protect established crops from cold as well as to protect seedlings from insects.</p>
<div id="attachment_6313" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6313 " title="porbar_gh1day1_20081007" src="http://www.ethicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/porbar_gh1day1_20081007-300x225.jpg" alt="porbar_gh1day1_20081007" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kevin and Amy Leamer</p></div>
<p><strong>The Leamers:</strong> We have (2) 24' X 48' plastic covered (inflated double layer) greenhouses and (2) 30' X 120' plastic covered (single layer) high tunnels. The tunnels each have (7) 3' X 120' raised beds giving us approx. 1,600 row feet for our crops. This provides us valuable season extension and year-round growing capabilities. Our growing system utilizes only passive solar heating and non-powered mechanical ventilation and wind for cooling.</p>
<p>We combined his seasonal variety suggestions (with our own personal tastes considered), crop rotations, Integrated Pest Management practice (intercropping, something we learned from Joe Kovach and his test plots at the <a href="http://www.oardc.ohio-state.edu/">Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center </a>in Wooster), and various information amassed over a good part of 10 years or more through our own large gardening/small farming experiences.</p>
<p>We constantly replenish our soil ecosystem with Eliot's green manure crop strategies, and our favorite "farm machinery" is his broadfork that we use for gently working our raised bed soil.</p>
<p><strong>What have been your results so far?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>The Bartholomaes: </strong>We moved to the farm last October, got our first tunnel covered by November, seeds started indoors in December and January for planting in the tunnel in February, and with the increasing day length at that point, things grew like mad. It was so gratifying! We harvested spinach, greens mixes, lettuce, radishes, beets, carrots. We then transitioned to warm weather crops in the tunnel: peppers, eggplant and tomatoes. This summer we sold at two farmers markets and for <a href="http://www.freshforkmarket.com/">Fresh Fork</a> online, and this winter we are selling at two markets.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6315" title="porbar_ht1_2009" src="http://www.ethicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/porbar_ht1_2009-300x225.jpg" alt="porbar_ht1_2009" width="300" height="225" />The Leamers: </strong>We've witnessed the obvious advantages of having fresh "out of season" varieties available, improved plant/fruit quality, and excellent natural pest/disease control. The most rewarding aspect has been the positive interactions with market customers who seem to share our enthusiasm for a "fresh" approach to farming. We are quite humbled, yet motivated by the praise and encouragement given by quite a diversified age range and demographic of our customer base.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get interested in the Local Roots market?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>The Bartholomaes:</strong> I think it was through Dave Benchoff whom we had met at last year's Ohio Ecological Food and Farm Association (OEFFA) Conference. [Note: Dave is a member of the Local Roots board, past president of the local <a href="http://www.oeffa.org">OEFFA</a> chapter, and co-owner of <a href="http://www.banzhafgarten.com/">Banzhaf Garten Organic Farm</a>.] We are just so excited to be able to provide beautiful produce in the winter and are thinking this will ultimately be our greater focus than growing during the height of the summer season, when competition is stiff and there's a glut of produce. We are thrilled that all the amazing folks at Local Roots have made this really happen and are excited to have a regular outlet for our produce!</p>
<p><strong>The Leamers:</strong> We learned about Local Roots from a producer member at the Medina Farmers' Market this summer. We visited the web site and were immediately impressed with the professional, well-organized, progressive approach to providing fresh local food. We joined promptly. Local Roots will provide us an excellent opportunity to expand our market potential year-round to provide fresh local food especially during the traditionally dormant Ohio winter.</p>

But if you order tuna in your neighborhood sushi restaurant, you too could be chewing the wrong thing — specifically, southern bluefin tuna (<em>Thunnus maccoyii</em>), a species classified as critically endangered by the <a href="International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a> (IUCN).</p>
<p>This is one of the disturbing findings in a new paper in the open access journal <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007866">PLoS ONE</a> (hat tip to <a href="http://twitter.com/tlaskawy">Tom Laskawy</a>): "The Real <em>maccoyii</em>: Identifying Tuna Sushi with DNA Barcodes – Contrasting Characteristic Attributes and Genetic Distances." (A note on the title's wordplay: <em>Maccoyii</em> is the species name for the southern bluefin tuna, <em>Thunnus maccoyii</em>, and plays on an old expression meaning the "genuine article" — one that has a  murky origin, says <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-mcc1.htm">World Wide Words</a>.) The authors and their collaborators collected 68 samples of tuna sushi from 31 restaurants in New York City and Denver. Whenever a tuna species was listed on the menu — "bluefin," for example — the team ordered it. At restaurants that did not list the species on the menu, they went for "regular" (<em>akami</em>) and "fatty" (<em>toro</em>) tuna. If the menu didn't list a species, they first asked the staff, "What kind of tuna is it?" and then "What species of tuna?" if the answer the to first query was not a valid species ("red tuna," for example).</p>
<p>DNA analysis was performed on each sample to determine the species of fish, as well as to develop a "cytochrome c oxidase subunit I character-based key" to assist others in speciating tuna samples. Not surprisingly, they discovered numerous problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vagueness and/or ignorance: 79% of the menus did not list any species of tuna. When staff was asked for a clarification, 32% of the clarifications were incorrect and 9% were not helpful (for example, answering with a non-existent species).</li>
<li>Mislabeling (or perhaps outright fraud): On numerous occasions, the restaurant staff told the customer that the fish was bluefin but served much cheaper bigeye tuna. (But all eight times when the menu specified bluefin tuna, bluefin was actually served.)</li>
<li>Hiding the unpleasant truth (or avoiding controversy):  Several restaurants served northern bluefin tuna (<em>T. thynnus</em>) or the critically endangered southern bluefin tuna (<em>T. maccoyii</em>) despite a generic menu listing of tuna and a verbal clarification of "bigeye." The authors postulate that selling the more expensive bluefin as a lesser grade tuna was a way of avoiding controversy, like the one that has been facing the Nobu chain of restaurants (previously covered at the <a href="http://www.ethicurean.com/2009/06/12/bluefin-tuna/">Ethicurean</a> and in links therein).</li>
<li>Revolting food:  Five of the nine times they ordered "white tuna" from the menu, instead of receiving the expected albacore (<em>T. alalunga</em>), the researchers were served escolar (<em>Lepidocybium flavorunneum</em>). Escolar is banned for sale in Italy and Japan because the high level of wax esters in the fish's flesh can cause serious side effects including "mild and rapid passage of oily yellow or orange droplets, to severe diarrhea with nausea and vomiting. The milder symptoms have been referred to as <em>keriorrhea</em> [i.e. flow of wax in Greek]." Although the fish can be sold legally in the U.S., <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/RetailFoodProtection/ManagingFoodSafetyHACCPPrinciples/Operators/ucm078063.htm">Annex 2</a> of the FDA's Hazard Analysis &#38; Critical Control Point (HACCP) manual for operators recommends that "Escolar should not be marketed in interstate commerce." So you might want to think twice before ordering "white tuna" when you next go out for sushi. (Wikipedia has more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escolar">escolar</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.ethicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/tuna-photo-by-dogonthesidewalk-from-flickr.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4018" title="Photo of tuna at Tsukiji market by dogonthesidewalk at flickr" src="http://www.ethicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/tuna-photo-by-dogonthesidewalk-from-flickr-300x212.jpg" alt="Photo of tuna at Tsukiji market by dogonthesidewalk at flickr" width="300" height="212" /></a>Despite the article's "gotcha" feeling, the research has very important implications for the survival of bluefin tuna. One of the prerequisites for a <a href="http://www.cites.org/">Convention on International Trade Endangered Species</a> (CITES) listing is that the species needs to be identifiable in trade contexts so that violations can be reliably detected. The authors claim that their method reliably identifies all species of tuna, thus meeting the CITES prerequisite. Monaco has formally proposed that northern bluefin tuna be added to Appendix I of CITES during the <a href="http://www.cites.org/eng/ news/sundry/2009/CoP15_dates.shtml">15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES</a> that will be held in March 2010 in Doha, Qatar (<a href="http://www.cites.org/common/cop/15/raw_props/E-15%20Prop-MC%20T%20thynnus.pdf">PDF</a>). And just last week, a majority of an <a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/38195/icode/">FAO advisory panel</a> agreed that the available evidence supports Appendix I listing (via <a href="http://www.lavidalocavore.org/diary/2886/great-news-for-bluefin-tuna-and-sharks">La Vida Locavore</a>). If listed, trade of the fish will be permitted "only in exceptional circumstances."</p>
<p>The authors recommend that FDA modify the <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/SEARCH_SEAFOOD/index.cfm?other=complete">Seafood List</a>, which recognizes appropriate "market names" for most of the seafood species sold in the U.S.  Currently, the FDA allows seafood marketers to use the term "tuna" to describe all species of the genus (and several other fish outside of genus <em>Thunnus)</em>. A requirement that bluefin tuna must be marketed as bluefin tuna would reduce uncertainty and protect against fraud.</p>
<p>At a more local level, sushi eaters can help the bluefin by <em>not ordering any tuna sushi</em> except when you have exceptional confidence that the restaurant can confirm that bluefin tuna is not being served.</p>

Not surprisingly, the initiative is a failure, according to an independent study commissioned by the California-based group <a href="http://publications.childrennow.org/publications/media/adstudy_2009.htm">Children Now</a>. The study reports that 72.5% of foods advertised on television during children's programs fall into the poorest nutritional category. Before the initiative began, 84% was. If you are looking for ads about fruits and vegetables, be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait: the authors found that you'd need to watch children's programs for <em>10 hours</em> before seeing one. In that same time, Junior sees 55 ads for the poorest category of foods and 20 for the medium category.  The study also finds fault with the use of "licensed" characters (like Spongebob Squarepants) as promoters of nutritionally barren foods.  The report suggests that it is time for Congress to start regulating advertising to children. A Federal Trade Commission hearing (<a href="http://ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/sizingup/Agenda.pdf">PDF</a>) will be held on December 15 to examine food and beverage advertising to children.

<p>Josh Harkinson writes in <a href="http://motherjones.com/environment/2009/11/street-food-fight">Mother Jones</a> about a lavish conference on Street Food at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa, California. Around devotees of the fresh, exciting flavors of global street food circled corporate scouts looking for the next big thing — perhaps a recipe for the freezer case, a new appetizer for the nationwide menu, or a plan for a fleet of trucks. harkinson also looks at what defines street food, and whether it can be made from sustainable ingredients.</p>
<p>Over at the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/01/AR2009120100847.html">Washington Post</a>, Jane Black wades through the confusing and often self-contradictory tangle of red tape that can envelop those who make and sell street food or cook in mobile kitchens. The Local SixFortySeven truck in Virginia encounters rural agricultural zoning rules, business license confusion and more. The famous Kogi BBQ truck of metro-Los Angeles is another case study: the L.A. area is comprised of scores of cities, which seem to have different rules and permit procedures. Not all of the trouble is directly from the government, as exclusive contracts for caterers can keep trucks away from some places, while restaurant pressure on local governments can keep streets free of food trucks in other places.</p>

I think of a third: sardines.</p>
<p>Two days after Thanksgiving, I took a day trip to Monterey to see the dramatic coastline and experience some of city's connection with sardines firsthand. I skipped the aquarium on this visit, instead taking a quick walk along Cannery Row and visiting the <a href="http://www.montereyhistory.org/museum.htm">Monterey Maritime Museum</a> in search of information about the history of Monterey sardines. In my wanderings, I came across some interesting historical documents and found that locally canned sardines are returning to Cannery Row.</p>
<p><strong>Sardines then</strong><br />
In the mid-20th century, the sardine fishery off the Monterey coast seemed bottomless, resulting in a network of canneries along the waterfront (Cannery Row, a place made famous by the John Steinbeck novel of the same name, and now a top tourist destination of Monterey). At their peak, they processed millions of pounds of fish each year while providing jobs to thousands*. In the 1940s, the Pacific coast sardine catch accounted for around 25% of the total seafood catch in the U.S., making it a key part of the war effort. But it was not to last. By the mid-1940s, the fish were gone, the canneries closing, as the chart below shows (it is from another post on sardines at <a href="http://marcsala.blogspot.com/2009/02/great-california-sardine-boom-and-bust.html">Mental Masala</a>). The current thinking is that a combination of overfishing, pollution, and the natural cycle of the sardine contributed to the rapid decline in the late 1940s.</p>

<p><strong>Sardines now</strong>…<br />
Sardines are once again being netted along the California coast, this time under strict regulation by the state of California — in 2002, over 80,000 tons of sardines were landed in California, according to a Seafood Watch report on the Pacific Sardine (<a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/content/media/MBA_SeafoodWatch_PacificSardineReport.pdf">PDF</a>). Although more than 90% of the fish are exported to be turned into bait, fishmeal, fish oil and pet food, a Monterey entrepreneur is trying to bring canned sardines back to Cannery Row (and elsewhere).</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Cannery Row shopping area" src="http://www.canneryrow.com/img/monterey-canning-co.png" alt="" width="279" height="143" />While strolling through the maze-like Cannery Row complex — which is now a collection of shops, restaurants and unusual museums — I ran across the <a href="http://www.canneryrowsardineco.com/">Cannery Row Sardine Co.</a>, a new venture started by Daren Warnick. Seeing a nexus between the renewed sardine harvest, interest in omega-3 rich foods and the local foods movement, Warnick made an arrangement with fishers and one of few fish canneries in the area, <a href="http://www.davesalbacore.com/">Dave’s Gourmet Albacore</a> in Santa Cruz, to produce a new line of canned California-coast sardines, complete with a label that looks like those printed in the boom times. The canned sardines are sold by mail and in a few places in the Monterey area.</p>
<p>An excellent article by Kera Abraham in the <a href="http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/archives/2009/2009-Oct-01/sardines-make-a-comeback-on-cannery-row/1/">Monterey County Weekly</a> describes the history of the sardine business, the company's origin, and some of the challenges presented by sardines. Although the price of fresh-caught sardines is shockingly low — most sell for 3 to 6 cents per pound — the small size of the fish and lack of canning infrastructure make it easier to ship them overseas for processing and canning  — often to the Philippines, where the cost of labor is low  — and then shipped back to the U.S. for sale.</p>
<p>Sardines are getting press more and more respect. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/06/02/ST2009060202779.html">Washington Post</a> had a multi-article feature on the fish and its fans, as did the <a href="Giuliani to help Rio in pre-Olympic crime fight  Friday, December 4, 2009  (12-04) 09:26 PST RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) --  Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani says Rio de Janeiro can become a safe city before it hosts the 2016 Olympics. And his consulting firm will be paid to offer advice on how to make that happen.  Giuliani visited a slum in Rio on Thursday and praised Rio's efforts to bring order to the violence-plagued areas where drug traffickers hold sway.  Rio Governor Sergio Cabral says that Giuliani's consulting firm will be contracted to give security advice. Details of the deal were not disclosed.  Giuliani oversaw a drastic drop in crime in New York during his tenure as mayor from 1994 to 2002. Backers attributed the improvement to his zero-tolerance stance.  http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2009/12/04/sports/s091015S34.DTL">Atlantic Monthly</a>, and the San Jose Mercury News (a piece by <a href="http://skilletchronicles.com/content/?p=1552">Aleta Watson</a> that I cannot find on-line).</p>
<p>Creating bigger markets for sardines that will be directly eaten by people could be good not only for fans of the fish and entrepreneurs like Warnick, but also potentially the ocean. Fishery experts say that these new direct markets will allow a higher price for fresh fish, thus leading fishing boats to catch far fewer fish to pay their expenses. I think that makes a certain amount of sense, but also think that fishing boats will still catch the quota, selling whatever they can for a variety of prices.</p>
<p><strong>The other chicken</strong> <strong>of the sea</strong><br />
Among the ship models, artifacts, and explanatory signage at the Maritime Museum in the historic heart of Monterey (home to some very important California history, like the Customs House, the oldest government building in California; and <a href="http://www.monterey.org/museum/coltonhall.html">Colton Hall</a>, the location of the state's first constitutional convention — and hopefully not the last, given California's FUBAR constitution), I found some interesting displays about the now-gone sardine and abalone industries.</p>
<p>Alongside a label from SARD-X  — a fertilizer made from sardines  — a sign explained that around 1920 the canneries began making a chicken feed from the bones and other wastes from sardine processing. It resulted in better chicken at lower costs, aiding in the preservation of the California chicken industry. The museum quotes a biologist who said that "Foster Farms Chickens owes its life to the bones of the Monterey sardine."</p>
<p>As the fishery ramped up and the quantity of fish caught surpassed the demand for fresh and canned fish, companies started to convert (or "reduce") whole fish into fishmeal and fish oil for livestock feed and fertilizer. During one period, there were even ship-based reduction plants for sardines and anchovies that floated outside California's territorial waters to avoid government limits on how much fish could be directly reduced to meal and oil.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ethicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/img_8727.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6258" title="img_8727" src="http://www.ethicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/img_8727.jpg" alt="img_8727" width="336" height="242" /></a></p>
<p>Near the SARD-X label was a reprint of an advertisement from the 1945 Pacific Fisherman Yearbook showing smiling livestock and touting the benefits of fish as feed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Special fish caught way out in the ocean are processed while fresh and converted into "those priceless ingredients" FISH MEAL and FISH OIL. We like it because it's good for us. We lay more and better eggs, and put on more weight. We have more and better children."</p>
<p>The Government has put us on ration points, now we only get 1 part of Fish Meal mixed with 39 parts of other feed; without the Fish Meal we feel very bad, we want more, but we also want to get the war finished.</p>
<p>....if you live in any part of the United States you can receive the benefits of fish caught in the ocean by way of — better eggs, poultry and bacon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Livestock feed or fertilizer is a perfectly good way to fully utilize heads, tails and entrails as a resource. Directly processing perfectly edible fish like sardines and anchovies, however, into meal is another matter. In today's food system, a significant fraction of the fish caught at sea ends up in animal feed. A 2005 review in <a href="http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.energy.30.081804.121034">Annual Review of Environment and Resources</a>, estimated that of the 95 million metric tons captured from wild fisheries in 2001, nearly 20% goes to feed chickens, pigs, and other livestock. In past years, fishmeal has been inexpensive, as fishing technology improves and new waters are opened up to exploitation. The anchoveta (<a href="http://eol.org/pages/206650">Engraulis ringens</a>) fishery off the coast of Peru has only been operating at large scale only since 1958; it currently supplies about 10 million metric tons of fish each year, which is almost all reduced to fishmeal and fish oil (H/T to Jennifer of <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/guiltyplanet/">Guilty Planet</a> for pointing me to the paper containing this information)**.</p>
<p>I'll have more to say about fishmeal in a future post.</p>

<p><em>* The canneries produced such noxious odors that some people called the city "Monterey-by-the-Smell," a reference to nearby "Carmel by the Sea."

<p>While short on concrete solutions--probably because they have yet to be created--Donohue's piece jumps from a Slow Food city potluck to Florida tomato fields to the halls of San Francisco public school dining halls to drive home her point: good-food folks need to start thinking seriously about equity. And while some pioneers, among them the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and foodservice company Bon Appetit Management Co., are leading the charge, there's much work ahead if farm laborers, low-income eaters, and other traditionally "invisible" groups are to take their seat at the healthy, local table.
