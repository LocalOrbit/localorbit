== Installation ==

1. Upload the `add-to-any-subscribe` directory (including all files within) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

1. Go to `Appearance` -> `Widgets` and click `Add` next to "Add to Any Subscribe"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often is the list of services updated? =

Constantly... and it's done automatically without having to upgrade.

= Where can I choose which button to display and other options? =

Go to `Settings` > `Subscribe Buttons`. 

= Why isn't the drop-down menu appearing for the button? =

It's likely because your your theme wasn't <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks" target="_blank">coded properly</a>.  Using the Theme Editor, make sure that the following piece of code is included in your theme's `footer.php` file just before the `</body>` line:

`<?php wp_footer(); ?>`

= How come the widget doesn't display once I activate it? =

You'll have to manually put it where you want it in your sidebar.  You can do so by going to `Presentation` > `Widgets` and clicking `Add` next to "Add to Any Subscribe".  You'll need to have a "widget ready" theme.

If you have already added the widget but the actual button is not displaying, you should reinstall the widget, making sure to copy the actual `add-to-any-subscribe` folder (and all of its contents) to your plugins folder.

Also, be sure to deactivate any previous versions of the widget in the `Plugins` tab.

= What if I don't have a "widget ready" theme, or I want to place the button somewhere else? =

Using the Theme Editor, you can place the following code in your template pages (within sidebar.php, index.php, single.php, and/or page.php):

`<?php if( class_exists('Add_to_Any_Subscribe_Widget') ) { Add_to_Any_Subscribe_Widget::display(); } ?>`

= How can I customize the feed of the widget? (Useful for comment feeds, category feeds, etc.) =

This can be done through the template tag (as described above).  Simply supply a feed name and feed URL through the template tag like so:

`<?php if( class_exists('Add_to_Any_Subscribe_Widget') ) {
	$A2A_SUBSCRIBE_options = array(
		"feedname" => "Name of the Feed",
		"feedurl" => "http://www.example.com/feed");
	Add_to_Any_Subscribe_Widget::display( $A2A_SUBSCRIBE_options );
} ?>`

= Why do embedded objects (like Flash) disappear when the menu is displayed? =

This is done to overcome browser limitations that prevent the drop-down menu from displaying on top of intersecting embedded objects.  If you would like to disable this, uncheck the `Hide embedded objects (Flash, video, etc.) that intersect with the menu when displayed` option on the plugin's settings page.

= For WordPress MU (WPMU), how can I set the plugin to automatically execute so that it's available as a widget for all blogs? =

Upload the plugin directory (including all files within) to the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` folder, then move the `add-to-any-subscribe.php` file from the plugin directory to the `mu-plugins` folder so that it can auto-execute.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is the Add to Any Subscribe button
2. This is the drop-down menu that appears instantly when visitors move the mouse over the Subscribe button
3. This is the drop-down menu showing the services available to the user within the Subscribe menu.  Services are constantly added/updated.
