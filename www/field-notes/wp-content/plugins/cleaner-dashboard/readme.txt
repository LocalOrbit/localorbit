Removes the WordPress news sections and reorganizes the sidebar for maximum screen usage. See the screenshots for more details.

== Description ==

This plugin does two things to your dashboard:

* The WordPress News and Other WordPress News sections are removed. You don't even load them. Why? So you won't have to bother 
  with the AJAX call for the news. Also, it looks neater.
* The sidebar (with incoming links, recent posts, etc.) is made more horizontal, with four columns instead of the default one. 
  This makes it so you can see all the information at one glance, rather than having to scroll down.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `cleaner-dashboard.php` to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin.
3. Go to your dashboard, and enjoy its cleanliness!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if we miss an update because the news is not there anymore? =

No worry. If you're on WordPress 2.3 or above, then update checking is already in WordPress and a separate notification will 
be given to you.

1. The new dashboard. Cleaner, neater, and did I mention cleaner?
