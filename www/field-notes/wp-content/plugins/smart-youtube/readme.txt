Thanks.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2. Go to the Plugins page and activate the plugin.
3. Use the Options page to change your options
4. When you want to display Youtube video in your post, copy the video URL to your post and change http:// to httpv:// (notice the 'v' character)

TTo use the video in your posts, paste YouTube video URL with httpv:// (notice the 'v').

Important: The URL should just be copied into your post normally and the letter 'v' added, do not create a clickable link!

Example: httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWfksMD4PAg

If you want to embed High/HD Quality video use httpvh:// instead (Video High Defintion).

Vimeo Example: httpv://vimeo.com/27287078

Metacafe Example: httpvh://vww.metacafe.com/watch/7815470/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_dvd_interview/

Live Leak Example: httpv://www.liveleak.com/view?i=cad_1322822486

To embed playlists use httpvp:// (eg. httpvp://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=528026B4F7B34094)

Smart Youtube also supports migrated blogs from Wordpress.com using [youtube=youtubeadresss]

    httpv:// - regular video
    httpvh:// - high/HD quality
    httpvp:// - playlist
    httpvhp:// - HD playlist
    [youtube=youtubeadresss] - supported for blogs migrated from wordpress.com



Additionally, you can set how do you want the video to be displayed in your RSS feed. Smart Youtube can show the preview image of the video (automatically grabbed from Youtube), the link to the video, or both. I recommend enabling only the preview image.
