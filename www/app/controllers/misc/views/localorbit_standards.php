<h2>How we define local:</h2>
<p>Local for us is within 300 miles of the hub OR within the same state.</p>
<br />
<p>Local artisan producers and processors may use non-local ingredients if they are not available locally and if the ingredients they use ensure the human, animal welfare and environmental practices of Local Orbit sellers.</p>
<br />
<h2>How you define local:</h2>
<p>It's up to you! You decide the distance you want your food to travel by choosing farms that meet your own standards of what's local. We encourage you to look at the map for each seller and product that lets you know where your food comes from.</p>
<br />
<p>In the future, we'll add a feature that enables you to enter your distance preferences in your profile and we'll customize your product search to meet your criteria.</p>
