<h1>Local Orbit supports regional networks of buyers and sellers.</h1>


We create custom marketplaces for local food systems, with e-commerce, marketing, inventory management, fulfillment and logistics services to help regional food system partners leverage existing physical resources and networks.
<br />
Our back-office business tools and dedicated customer service lets farmers focus on producing food, while market managers focus on supporting farmers and cultivating relationships with buyers.
<br />
We help delivery service providers operate at full capacity, reducing waste and increasing revenue.
<br />
Our tools and best practices help people work together more effectively, spend less time communicating and organizing information - and reach more buyers.
<br />
We're also building a network of market managers and food hubs to share best practices and solve common problems.
<br />
Working together, everyone gets a more transparent, equitable, profitable and sustainable food system.
<br />
Would Local Orbit's marketplace tools help your business or organization? We'll be adding new hubs later this year and we'd love to hear from you.
