	Local Orbit is building flexible, localized tools designed to help people build healthier communities through better food.  
	<br />&nbsp;<br />
	Our web platform provides custom online marketplaces and back-office infrastructure for businesses and people working to increase local food distribution.
	<br />&nbsp;<br />
	Local Orbit has evolved through two years of conversations with farmers, food producers, chefs, eaters and people working to solve food distribution challenges. We've heard countless stories about disconnected markets and inefficient communications. 
	<br />&nbsp;<br />
	People are hungry for food that's produced by farmers, ranchers and artisans they know and trust. They want to spend a larger share of their food dollars in their own communities.
	<br />&nbsp;<br />
	Local Orbit’s services create stronger, more efficient food networks that can meet the demand for food that’s produced closer to where we live.
