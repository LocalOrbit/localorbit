<h1>Local Orbit supports regional networks of buyers and sellers.</h1>
<p><img src="img/misc/SellLocalsm.jpg" alt="" class="pagePics"  style="float:right;" />We create custom marketplaces for local food systems, with e-commerce, marketing, inventory management, fulfillment and logistics services to help regional food system partners leverage existing physical resources and networks.</p>
<br />
<p>Our back-office business tools and dedicated customer service lets farmers focus on producing food, while market managers focus on supporting farmers and cultivating relationships with buyers.</p>
<br />
<p>We help delivery service providers operate at full capacity, reducing waste and increasing revenue.</p>
<br />
<p>Our tools and best practices help people work together more effectively, spend less time communicating and organizing information - and reach more buyers.</p>
<br />
<p>We're also building a network of market managers and food hubs to share best practices and solve common problems.</p>
<br />
<p>Working together, everyone gets a more transparent, equitable, profitable and sustainable food system.</p>
<br />
<p>Would Local Orbit's marketplace tools help your business or organization? We'll be adding new hubs later this year and we'd love to hear from you.</p>
