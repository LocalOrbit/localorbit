<h1>Local Orbit Privacy and Security Policy</h1> 

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how your information is protected, collected and used. Updates may be made periodically. Any changes will be posted on Local Orbit and Local Orbit will provide notice of materially significant changes to this Privacy Policy by posting notice on Local Orbit.</p>
<br />
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective on June 25, 2009.</p>

<h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
<p>Local Orbit will never abuse your trust.  This means that we will never share, sell, rent or otherwise disclose your personal or company information without your explicit consent.</p>
 <br />
<p>Out of respect for your privacy, Local Orbit does not:</p>

<ul>
<li>Place monitoring devices onto your computer such as web beacons, or single-pixel gifs.</li>
<li>Sell or distribute a member's information to third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
<li>Send unsolicited communications for marketing purposes.</li>
<li>Run banner ads, pop ups, pop unders, or any other kind of commercial ads.</li>
</ul>
 <br />
<p>To ensure the integrity of our privacy policy and to prevent unauthorized access to account information we have established physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your account information. All account information is encrypted and stored on our servers in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  </p> 

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>We respect your privacy as a basic Community principle.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Our goal when collecting information is to provide users with a convenient, efficient, and safe experience. You agree that your personal information may be used to provide the services you request, provide customer support, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, collect fees, prevent illegal activities, enforce our User Agreement, and improve our services.</p>

<h2>Collection</h2>
<p>You are welcome to browse Local Orbit without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information to our servers located in the United States. We may collect and store the following personal information:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Email address, physical contact information.</li>
<li>Transactional information based on your activities on Local Orbit (such as buying, selling, products and content you generate or that relates to your account).</li>
<li>Community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through Local Orbit, and correspondence sent to us.</li>

<li>Computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from Local Orbit, ad data, and other information, including IP address and standard web log information.</li>
<li>Supplemental information submitted for verification or requested if site policies are suspected to be violated.</li>
<li>Supplemental information from third parties (for example, rating feedback).</li>
</ul>
 
<br />
<h2>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p>We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. We may also share your personal information with:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded credit cards).</li>
<li>Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service).</li>

<li>Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity.</li>
<li>Other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the Community free from wrongdoing, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</p>
 <br />
<h2>Information You Share on Local Orbit</h2>
<p>Your business name is displayed throughout Local Orbit (and so available to the public), and is connected to all of your Local Orbit activity. Other people can see your items for sale, Profile Page, ratings, feedback and associated comments. Notices sent to other Community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our site refer to your business name and specific item listings. So if you associate your name with your business, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your Local Orbit activities.</p>
<br />
<p>If you access our site from a shared computer or a computer in an internet caf√©, certain information about you, such as your email address, activity or reminders from Local Orbit, may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.</p>
<br />
<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain of our pages to help analyze our web page flow; customize our services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness; and promote trust and safety.</p>
<br />
<p>A few important things you should know about cookies are that:</p>

<ul>
<li>We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.</li>
<li>Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.</li>
<li>You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of our site or services.</li>
<li>You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the site that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)</li>
<li>Cookies allow us to recognize you automatically whenever you visit our site so that we can personalize your experience and provide you with better service.</li>
<li>If your web browser is set to refuse cookies from our website, you will not be able to complete a purchase  or take advantage of all the features of Local Orbit. As a result, we strongly encourage you to configure your web browser to accept cookies from our website.</li>

<li>Cookies are just short pieces of data, and they are unable to perform any operation by themselves.</li>
<li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to set your browser to accept new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2>No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing</h2>
<p>Local Orbit and our users do not tolerate spam. You are not licensed to add other Local Orbit users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report Local Orbit-related spam or spoof emails, please contact us. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our Community, we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these email addresses.</p>
<br />
<h2>Account Protection</h2>
<p>Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify Local Orbit and change your password.</p> 
<br />
<h2>Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>You can see, review and change most of your personal information by becoming a member of Local Orbit. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<br />
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We take the security of our customers' information very seriously, and we use every method possible to make sure that your online buying and selling experience is a safe one.</p>
<p>Your information is stored on our PCI Compliant servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and our site meets PCI Compliance. Security tools include Advanced Policy Firewall to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>
<p>Payments are processed by Paypal.com, a company with a proven reputation for security and reliability. PayPal stores personal information on its servers, which are heavily guarded, both physically and electronically.</p>
 <br />
<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on our site or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Local Orbit does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
