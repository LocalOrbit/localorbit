<h1>The Local Orbit Guarantee</h1>
<br /> 
<h2 class="no_underline"><img src="img/misc/OurGuaranteePagesm.jpg" alt="" class="pagePics"  style="float:right;border:1px solid black;"> Our Guarantee to Buyers</h2>

<p>If you experience a problem with our service or any product sold through Local Orbit, please let us know. We'll do whatever it takes to make it right. We really do appreciate the opportunity to fix a problem. It helps us build a better service and we hope it will keep you coming back.</p>
<br />
<p>We ask that you try to let us know about a problem with your food order within 24 hours after you get it so we can let the Seller know the situation.  Our Sellers share our commitment to customer service and they work with us to make you happy.</p>
<br />
<p>We do what you want. If you'd like a store credit or a refund, no problem. Want the Seller to replace it? They will if it's still available! Want something else instead? We'll do our best to help you find it. Just want to talk and give us some suggestions for improvement? Thank you, we'll listen!</p>
<br />

<h2>The Customer-Company Pact</h2>

<p>We found this open source pact when researching examples of great customer service. </p> 
<br />
<p>We like the emphasis on trust and relationships because we are building a transparent, direct sales network that lets you get to know the people who produce your food and supporting sustainable food systems. We also like it because Local Orbit is a new way to buy and sell food, which means that we need your help creating a really useful service for buyers and sellers.  </p>
<br /> 
<p>Let us know what <a href="http://localorbit.zendesk.com/anonymous_requests/new">you think</a>.</p>
